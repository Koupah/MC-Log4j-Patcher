# MC-Log4J-Patcher  
The goal of this project is to provide Minecraft players, and server owners, peace of mind in regards to the recently discovered Log4J exploit (CVE-2021-44228).  
Currently this project looks for any Log4J format strings, not just `jndi`, and either replaces them or stops them from being logged entirely depending on your [configuration](#config).
